20719	" ""LAUGHTER""  @CAPS1 I hang out with my friends, the one thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh about is running into trash cans, laundry or maybe even about what we ate for dinner the @TIME1 before. @CAPS1 I am usual stressed out the one thing I love is to hangout with my friends. they usual are good listeners. overall. Though they take your mind off things. So with my friends you can count on having a great time no matter what the occasion is.    @CAPS1 I say trash can I really mean trash cans I remember this one time in the hall way at school my friend was hanging on to my back pack because she tends to loose me in the hall way a lot because I walk a lot faster then her, anyways the class bell had just rouge an all the student were heading to lunch we were. I was just getting ready to cross the hall way an she said don't do it, so I did an nobody stopped! so she kinda slide into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hall way, she @MONTH1 have knocked it off but I can't really say? I was still walking an the sound effects were so funny I laugh at it still.       My friend an I have a inside joke? we went out to lunch together. @CAPS1 we saw a laundry mate an I minds went crazy, we made up a funny joke an said that we should make our self's aprons with lots color and rhinestones, so that way if we wanted to get all of our laundry done at the same time. We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS1 our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.  Now about the food its sort of like the laundry but I guess better? I remember @CAPS1 i came to school the next day i just started talking about what i had for dinner @TIME1 i think at that time my mom had asked us if we wanted chicken @PERSON1 an my sister as i screamed an said hell yeah? so dinner was ready an @CAPS1 we went to go site at the table we looked at it an it was not what we expected it to be? it was frozen out of a box an it looked like somebody had eaten the food than puked it back up? it was that great looking.    All of these thing that have named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @CAPS1 there not drama i love my friend I don't think I could have asked for a better one because all we do is laugh an have fun an fun in to trash can locker an whatever else there is but the one thing that matter the most with my one friend is that @CAPS1 we get in to a fight we can not stay mad at each other well I now that I can't. So at the end of the day I ask her are we done being made at each other? an than we just look at each other an laugh because that about all we can do because the reason was so stupid there was really no need for it.that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us. but just to have fun an be silly. not anybody else but are self's an sometime @CAPS1 we have are really goofy days? we make up the story about our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than to laugh because deep down inside you an your friend will look back an say wow those where the best day was @CAPS1-would would get in trouble in class for talking way to much.

20722	"@CAPS3 I'm going to tell @CAPS18 a little story. I remember a time when @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I decided to make a snowman at @CAPS11 house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I say to him, I'm bored, @CAPS1 do @CAPS18 want to do?"" @PERSON1 replies,""@CAPS2 go make a snowman."" @CAPS3 I agree that that would be fun. @CAPS34 starts reaching for a jacket @CAPS3 gloves, but I stop him @CAPS3 say,"" @CAPS1 are @CAPS18 getting those for?"" ""@CAPS5's not cold @CAPS20."" ""@CAPS6,"" replies @PERSON1. ""@CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18.""   We start our snowman by building the base (The biggest piece for the bottom). @CAPS3 after about @NUM1 minutes the base is almost done, but we notice that we're getting cold. ""@CAPS7 we should go inside?"" @PERSON1 says. ""@CAPS8, I @CAPS7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate."" @CAPS9 off we go back inside hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate. I see @CAPS11 mom @CAPS3 ask, ""@CAPS10 we have some hot chocolate please?"" ""@CAPS11 @CAPS18 look cold, Of course I'll make @CAPS18 some."" @CAPS9 @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit downstairs waiting anxiously for our hot chocolate by the heater to get warm.   ""@CAPS5's ready!"" @CAPS11 mom calls from upstairs. We fly down the hall @CAPS3 rush up the stairs. @CAPS3 to our amazement we find not only hot chocolate but a bag of chips as @CAPS28. ""@CAPS14 mom!""I say. ""@CAPS14 @CAPS16 @CAPS17!""says @PERSON1. ""@CAPS18're welcome boys""says @CAPS11 mom. @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit down at the table @CAPS3 start drinking our hot chocolate, while @CAPS11 mom puts some chips on paper towels for us. I start eating the chips by the handfuls whereas @PERSON1 grabs one, just one. I ask him,"" @CAPS19 did @CAPS18 only grab one @PERSON1?"" @CAPS20 of the corner of his eye @CAPS34 looks at me @CAPS3 slowly brings the chip to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. As @CAPS34 did that I fell @CAPS20 of @CAPS11 chair in a fit of hysterical laughter.    @CAPS11 mom hears the thump of me hitting the floor @CAPS3 runs upstairs to find me laughing. ""@CAPS1's @CAPS9 funny?"" she asks. I say to @PERSON1, ""@CAPS22 her."" @PERSON1 then complies @CAPS3 grabs another chip @CAPS3 while @CAPS34 looks at her from the corner of his eye, slowly brings @CAPS5 to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. I start busting up laughing again, yet @CAPS11 mom doesn't see the humor. She simply asks,"" @CAPS23 is that @CAPS9 funny?"" @PERSON1 replies,"" I have no idea but @CAPS34 just about died from laughter. I start to stop laughing @CAPS3 I'm able to stand up again. I then tell @CAPS11 mom,"" @CAPS5's the way @CAPS34 looks at @CAPS18, @CAPS5 just makes @CAPS18 laugh.""   I then @CAPS35 to do the same thing, but with no effect to @PERSON1. ""@CAPS19 isn't @CAPS5 working?"" I ask. ""@CAPS26 I'm awesome like that @CAPS3 @CAPS18're @NUM2 says. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS28 I'm gonna keep at @CAPS5 until I get @CAPS5 right."" @CAPS9 I @CAPS35 to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I made happen was I spilled @CAPS11 hot chocolate all over myself, which made him laugh, albeit not the way I wanted to. ""@CAPS18 want me to @CAPS22 @CAPS18?"" @PERSON1 says. ""@CAPS31!!!! Please!"" I beg. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18."" @CAPS34 proceeds then to grab another chip @CAPS3 while looking at me from the corner of his eye, bites the chip. I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS3 without pause. After about @NUM1 minutes I stop laughing.   ""I'll get that right!"" I say. @PERSON1 says,""@CAPS35 @CAPS5."" I grab a chip @CAPS3 look straight at him @CAPS3 bite down, nothing. I @CAPS35 again, this time while looking at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye, nothing yet again. I @CAPS7 to myself, ""@CAPS36 I @CAPS33't get @CAPS5 this time I'm giving up."" ""@CAPS6, here goes."" I grab a chip @CAPS3 slowly bring @CAPS5 to @CAPS11 mouth while squinting at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye. I bite the chip. I notice @CAPS34's laughing. @CAPS34's laughing!!! ""I told @CAPS18 I'd get @CAPS5!"" "" @CAPS31, @CAPS31 @CAPS18 did."" @CAPS3 this is one of the many times laughter brought @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I together."""
20726	" Laughter, one of life's greatest gifts. Have you ever laughed so hard that you cried? What about laughed so hard you can't breath, or noise no longer escapes from your lips? I am the type of person that can @CAPS6 at something so stupid that when I get done laughing, I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can @CAPS6 so hard that nothing comes out at all! @CAPS1's amazing what laughter can do to a persons heart. The way @CAPS1 makes you feel, the way @CAPS1 makes you act. @CAPS1's so contagious, and @CAPS1 happens all around us everyday. You are never too old for laughter, @CAPS1 happens to the best of us. young or old, @CAPS1 doesn't matter. Laughter has no age limit. One time @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I stayed up until three in the @TIME1. We were so delirious, and kooky, we acted like crazy people. Now we have the type of relationship where we can @CAPS6 at almost anything. Literally almost anything... As we were staying up, we drank lots of soda and had sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We made up songs, we danced around @CAPS2 house, and @CAPS1 felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears were flowing out of @CAPS2 eyes, and i couldn't get a breath out of @CAPS2 heaving lungs. When @CAPS1 gets to the silent laughing, @CAPS1's even more funny because that person can't control @CAPS1, and they look so hilarious because there rocking back and forth, with this silly expression upon their face, not making any noise at all. Have you ever just laughed for what feels like a lifetime? How did you feel after that ""lifetime"" of laughter? @CAPS1 almost feels as something as powerful as the sun just warms over your heart and soul. When I @CAPS6 I feel all the happiness and emotion just flow all throughout @CAPS2 entire body. @CAPS1's one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a greater feeling than the warmth that laughter brings. @CAPS1's so great when you and a @CAPS3, or group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even when your feeling down, maybe need some cheering up. You can always depend on a @CAPS6 to pull you through. No matter what mood I'm in, @CAPS5 I hear someone laughing, @CAPS1 is so hard to not join in. Laughing is so contagious! @CAPS1 effects us in our everyday life's. I bet you that, you cannot go one day without hearing someone @CAPS6, or you not laughing yourself. I probably @CAPS6 about five hundred times a day, @CAPS5 not more. I love hearing people @CAPS6, @CAPS1 brightens @CAPS2 mood and also @CAPS2 day. I would most definitely say laughter is very important and beneficial for a relationship. I mean imagine the world without laughter. Boring, right? @CAPS2 advice, @CAPS6 like you heard the funniest thing in the world. @CAPS6 like there is no tomorrow. Who cares @CAPS5 people thinks its dumb. You'll feel much better after you have that tear-induced, hard to breath, silent but oh-so therapeutic @CAPS6. Laughter really is the shortest distance between people!"
20728	" Starting a story out with two @NUM1 @DATE1 old boys named @ORGANIZATION1 can already be considered a comedy. Those are the names of my identical twin cousins @ORGANIZATION1 I can honestly admit that they are @NUM2 of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the most intelligent human on earth, @ORGANIZATION1 by the way he named his children it's apparent that his sense of humor is a little bit off, but he's a really hard working man. Occasionally my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be a handful. Weekends are specifically better to have them over because of my hateful step siblings whom hate me, my brother, my sister, @ORGANIZATION1 even my mom. The amount of tension in the house isn't a healthy amount, so a couple of @NUM1 @DATE1 old running around livens it up a little @ORGANIZATION1 makes us all laugh together as a family. It must have been @DATE1 in @DATE2 when @CAPS7 was home @ORGANIZATION1 we were building onto our house when the twins came over. My mom was getting quite furious at their insanely high energy levels, she appeared to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My step dad @PERSON1 needed to go to @PERSON2's for nails @ORGANIZATION1 child locks @ORGANIZATION1 I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would have been a great idea to take the twins with us, just to relieve my mom of the loud mouths for a few minutes. We loaded up the car @ORGANIZATION1 I drove down the highway, amused with the twins in the back seat playing with the ponies @ORGANIZATION1 laughing at the people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like twinkle twinkle little star, @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION2's until we arrived in the @PERSON2's parking lot. @ORGANIZATION1 finds it pretty hilarious to run down the isles @ORGANIZATION1 hide behind items on the lower shelves, while @ORGANIZATION1 enjoys pretending he's @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 getting @CAPS7 confused. Eventually the twins were being too obnoxious, resulting in @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 me catching them @ORGANIZATION1 holding them as captives in the seat-belts of the @PERSON2's cart. It was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued along on our adventure in search of the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 found them down isle @NUM4. There was a large man standing in front of our destination @ORGANIZATION1 when i say large I don't mean muscular, or tall... I mean he probably has a few too many @CAPS1 shows he watches daily, @ORGANIZATION1 maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long @ORGANIZATION1 sandy blond, he wore a dark purple @CAPS2 die shirt @ORGANIZATION1 slip on sandals. @ORGANIZATION1 apparently hadn't realized how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude fashion, especially when they can hear you. He said, ""@CAPS3 cow @ORGANIZATION1 look at that lady! She's so huge!"" @ORGANIZATION1 laughed outrageously @ORGANIZATION1 agreed. ""@CAPS4! She's as big as our whole car!"" I panicked a bit @ORGANIZATION1 tried to get them to be quiet, however the twins paid @CAPS5 attention to me, they were much more excited to see the man on the tall ladder next to me giggling @ORGANIZATION1 laughing along with them. They were quiet for a moment then @ORGANIZATION1 gasped @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed, "" @CAPS5 she's as big as a fire truck!"" The man turned around @ORGANIZATION1 glared at me; i apologized at least @NUM5 times @ORGANIZATION1 started to take the boys out of the isle when the man on the ladder hit a button to make the ladder move. I was walking behind the larger man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beeping sound, like that of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear @ORGANIZATION1 shouted frantically, ""@CAPS6 run as fast as you can hurry! She's backing up @ORGANIZATION1 she's going to squish you on the floor!"" @CAPS7 laughed, even the man they were making fun of, but i was so embarrassed that i just took them to the car @ORGANIZATION1 waited for @PERSON1. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to a word i said. @PERSON1 only took approximately @NUM6 more minutes before he came jogging out the door with the nails, the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store @ORGANIZATION1 i chuckled quietly until @PERSON1 hopped into the truck, then i started laughing profusely. When I returned home I told my mom what had happened, she laughed for a while @ORGANIZATION1 i laughed even harder @ORGANIZATION1 quite a bit longer than i had before. I went to sleep with a fairly massive headache that night, but i think it was worth laughing all day for."
